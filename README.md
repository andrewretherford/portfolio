## Approach

I used a large project approach when building this site, following the normal stages and processes involved when planning for and executing an enterprise application.  The steps are outlined as follows:

1. Write up user stories to explore use cases and help define requirements
2. Based on user stories, create MVP and stretch goals
    1. Sort stretch goals into Bronze, Silver, and Gold
3. Create wireframes of all screens/pages on the site for design reference
3. Write pseudocode based on project goals
4. First round of implementation
    1. Review changes and confirm that they are in line with project goals
    2. Second round of implementation (and so on)

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub

### User Stories

 - As an employer, I want to easily find details about work history and experience, as well as personal outlook and brand in order to make an initial decision about interviewing a candidate without spending too much time
 - As a product owner I want to be able to get a feel for style and competence based on page architecture and design
 - As a friend I want to see cool stuff that my friend has built and have something that I can reference to network contacts
 - As a member of a generation not familiar or comfortable with navigating the internet, I want the interface to be simple and intuitive so that I can enjoy the content without becoming frustrated

## Still to Do

Although I was able to create a good working base, there is much that I would still like to do on my site.  Below is a roadmap of what I want to accomplish in the future.

- Update the font to something more fun
- Play with the CSS on the project page to make it more attractive
- Fine tune some of the JS interactions and add more of them
- Spend some time sourcing images for buttons and backgrounds that are more thematic and personalized
- Add another page with details about my current activities and projects in development
