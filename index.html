                    <p>A Software Engineer based in the San Francisco Bay Area.  When I’m not working I spend my time doing things that I love including gaming, archery, mountain biking, watching anime, or just learning how to do something new!</p>

                    <p>As an engineer, I draw great satisfaction from the magic of building something new and seeing it come to life.  I love discovering my own solution to a problem, and enjoy the challenge of finding the best way to implement it.  Working with others who are more skilled than I am inspires me, and I always welcome the opportunity to learn and grow.</p>

                        <!-- <h3>My Story</h3> -->
                        <p>I grew up in Carmel Valley, CA which is about 30 minutes from Carmel by the Sea, and lived in that area until I was 17.  Eager to find my way, I moved around a bit for school and work, trying out different career paths.  I lived in New York for a while which was an amazing experience. It was my first time living in a big city and I loved the culture there.  I also lived in Florida for a while before ending up in the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
                        <p>My first career was in the jewelry industry as a gemologist.  I went that route as I have a love of gemstones and a close friend recommended that I give it a try.  I enjoyed the field and had a great experience working for Tiffany & Co. in New York, but ultimately it wasn’t a good fit for me.  When I realized that it wasn't working out, I decided to chase my dream of working with technology.  I moved back to California and started taking classes at the local community college.  I worked in restaurants while going through school to support myself, and ultimately got my BS in Computer Information Science.</p>
                        <p>After that I worked in IT support for a while and was able to put some of my skills to use, however it still wasn’t quite what I was looking for.  I have always been fascinated with building software and found coding to be extremely engaging and rewarding.  With that in mind, I decided to make a career change by enrolling in a full stack software engineering course at General Assembly.  The course gave me an excellent foundation as a software engineer, and I have been enjoying building applications ever since.</p>
                        <p>In my personal life, I enjoy many activities from archery, surfing, and mountain biking, to gaming on my home built PC.  Pacifica is a great spot for these activities and I'm very lucky to be located 5 minutes away from the #4 archery range in the US. I'm also currently looking to find a good D&D group as I've always been interested in playing. I love the idea of solving puzzles and facing challenges with a team in a creative setting while also making good friends.</p>

                            <p>I built this app for myself as I was nearing the end of my software engineering bootcamp course and was looking for a good way to store and organize all of the notes and reference material that I had accumulated at that point.</p>
                            <p>This was my first project using Django and was an excellent challenge given that the structure is such a departure from React.  Once I got the hang of MVT vs. MVC however, it was actually a joy to work with given Django's deep built-in functionality. Some of the key hurdles that I faced during this project were centered around learning Django, as we only had the most basic introduction to setting up a Django app and creating functional views.  Learning how to pass data between templates, how to use class based views which have so much going on under the hood, and how to set up a full stack application with a file server for file uploads were chief among them.</p>
                            <p>While I still prefer the flexibility of React for applications not centered around file storage and management, I do very much enjoy the utility that Django provides in this area.</p>

                            <p>A class project and my first foray into React as well as using a third party backend.</p>
                            <p>I really enjoyed spending time on this project exploring as many different avenues of functionality in React as I could squeeze into it. I'm particularly proud that I was able to effectively learn useReducer and apply it in a single function for all of my back end calls.</p>
                            <p>While I did have fun on this project, I was often frustrated by the challenge of using a backend that I hadn't built and which ended up dictating much of what I was able to present on the frontend.  I was eager to move on to full stack applications where I could build and modify the backend as needed.</p>

                            <p>Meet 'N Eat is a full stack app that I built with a group of 4 engineers.  This was a great exercise in teamwork and dividing up tasks efficiently while not drifting apart in design scope and making sure that deliverables built separately were able to integrate and work with the whole.</p>
                            <p>I was the SCRUM master for this project and it was definitely a growth experience. I set the bar a bit high for my group unfortunately which lead to a lot of overtime and stress as we approached deadline. I learned the value of setting the bar lower for MVP and instead creating stretch goals for nice-to-have features.</p>
                            <p>Hiccups aside, we all enjoyed the project and it was great to have a team where we could think about dividing up work according to everyone's strengths instead of tackling everything individually.</p>

                            <p>This was an early homework assignment from my software engineering bootcamp.  While pretty basic, it was my first time building a game using browser events as opposed to a game loop.</p>
                            <p>I did initially build the game with a game loop using prompts for user input, however I finished early and thought it would be fun to try doing the whole thing with event listeners instead. It was an interesting experience as I found that using event listeners is structurally very different from a loop.</p>
                            <p>While not terribly impressive, this is a project that I was very proud of when I built it.</p>
